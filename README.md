# decryptor
This repository contains decryption tool. This tool swaps characters based on a custom mapping. This repository is intended for academic purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.

# How the code works
The All-Time Decryption Tool works by replacing the vowels in the encrypted text with the corresponding vowel character. The program uses a dictionary to map the encrypted vowel characters to the correct vowel character.

In this code I used the following:
The program will accept a string as encrypted text and then the program will decrypt it using the following character substitute:

**'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !**

See sample output:
Enter a string to decrypt: th& q!#ck br+wn f+x j!mps +v&r th& l*zy d+g. 
The Plain Text: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 

Installation
To run the program, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website.

**Note: I used VS Code to create and run the program.**
